1. Write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader. For example int the array {16, 19, 4, 3, 8, 3}, leaders are 19, 8 and 3?

2. Given an array arr[] of integers, find out the difference between any two elements such that larger element appears after the smaller number in arr[]. Examples: If array is [2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1] then returned value should be 8 (Diff between 10 and 2). If array is [ 7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2 ] then returned value should be 2 (Diff between 7 and 9)
